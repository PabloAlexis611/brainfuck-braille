# brainfuck-braille
A program written in Brainfuck that converts words containing characters from the Latin alphabet in braille patterns. The braille pattern used is the 6-dot braille code.

The code currently only supports basic latin, as described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters#Basic_Latin
